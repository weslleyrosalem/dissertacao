\begin{resumo}[\textit{Abstract}]
\textit{With the increasing digital transformation, managing IT environments, which are both complex and dynamic, has become an ever-greater challenge. Artificial Intelligence in IT Operations, or AIOps, emerges as a solution integrating machine learning and big data to automate IT management tasks, such as anomaly detection, capacity forecasting, event correlation, and root cause identification. The primary goal of this study is to combine the Transformer architecture with time series data from Prometheus, a monitoring system and time series database, to enhance predictive analysis and anomaly detection in IT systems. The research conducts a systematic review of the literature, establishing the theoretical foundations of the discussed technologies. The methodological section details the data sets used, the preprocessing steps, and the adopted predictive analysis techniques. The results of this study can significantly contribute to the efficiency of IT operations, facilitating the management of complexities present in current environments.}
